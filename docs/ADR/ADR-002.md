# ADR-002: [INSERT TITLE]

## Status
Accepted

## Context
I need to add state management and interactive components to the app using react.

**Requirements:**
- Improve interactiveness
- Support state management  

**Options considered:**
1. **React**: Familiar, quick to start, flexible

## Decision
We will use React for all new code in this project 

**Rationale:**
- Easier state management and improved state management

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Simplifies state management with built-in hooks (useState, useReducer, etc.)
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Enables creation of highly interactive UIs
- Reusable component architecture speeds up development

**Negative:**
- Adds a dependency and increases bundle size
- Learning curve for advanced React patterns
- Potential for over-engineering simple features

**Mitigation:**
- Use code splitting and tree shaking to minimize bundle size
- Provide onboarding resources and code reviews for team members new to React
- Regularly review code to avoid unnecessary complexity
